# Under Construction

As of this writing this repo contains stubs for the byu-footer and byu-header, but are set up to easily add other components as well. Documentation and testing have not been added yet, since we wanted to explore the possibility of integrating this version of the components with the byu-web-docs repo (https://github.com/byuweb/byu-web-docs, https://byuweb.github.io/byu-web-docs/).

# Future Enhancements

This repo can be improved in several ways, including:

- Better minification
- Supporting indented syntax for SCSS
- Adding a central location for SCSS variables and settings
- CSS/SCSS for Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)
- Fallback support for Edge (at least until the Chromium version comes out)
